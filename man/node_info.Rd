\title{Lineage Designation Node Information}
\usage{
node_info(tree, min.support, alignment, metadata, ancestral)
}
\arguments{
\item{tree}{A phylogenetic tree}

\item{min.support}{The minimum bootstrap support required}

\item{alignment}{The alignment in fasta format that corresponds to the tree}

\item{metadata}{The metadata corresponding to the sequences in the tree, including "ID" "assignment" "country" and "year"}

\item{ancestral}{The fasta file of the reconstructed ancestral sequences for the tree, generated by Treetime}
}
\value{
Information about the defining nodes of each designated lineage
}
\description{
This function designates the lineages of a set of sequences given the tree, alignment, ancestral reconstructions
and metadata of the sequences. The sequence IDs must match between all of these.
The metadata file must have a column called 'ID' which contains the ID's for all the sequences.
It also must have a column called 'year' that contains the collection year
of each sequence. Additionally, it must have a column called 'country'. This should contain the country of origin of each sequence.
If you don't have this information, you can leave the column blank but it needs to exist.
If you have more detailed information about the origin of the sequence (e.g. a state) you can put this in the country column instead of the country.
It also needs to have an 'assignment' column which contains any known clade assignments.
If you don't have this information, you can leave this column blank but it needs to exist.

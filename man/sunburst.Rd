\title{Lineage Figures - Sunburst}
\usage{
sunburst(lineage_info, node_data, tree, metadata, sequence_data)
}
\arguments{
\item{lineage_info}{The output of the lineage_info function}

\item{node_data}{The output of the node_info function}

\item{tree}{A phylogenetic tree}

\item{metadata}{The metadata corresponding to the sequences in the tree, including "ID" "assignment" "country" and "year"}

\item{sequence_data}{The output of the seq_designation function}
}
\value{
A sunburst plot showing the hierarchal relationship of the lineages
}
\description{
This group of Lineage Figure functions produce figures to assist in interpretation of lineage data.
}
\details{
This function produces a sunburst plot to visualise the hierarchical relationship of the lineages.
The outputs of the seq_designation, node_info and lineage_info functions are required, along with the
phylogenetic tree and corresponding metadata file used as input for the sequence data, node info and lineage
information.

\arguments{
\item{lineage_info}{The output of the lineage_info function}

\item{node_data}{The output of the node_info function}

\item{tree}{A phylogenetic tree}

\item{metadata}{The metadata corresponding to the sequences in the tree, including "ID" "assignment" "country" and "year"}

\item{sequence_data}{The output of the seq_designation function}

\description{
This group of Lineage Figure functions produce figures to assist in interpretation of lineage data.
}
\details{
This function produces a lineage tree with a lineage bar to visualise the phylogenetic positions of the lineages.

phylogenetic tree and corresponding metadata file used as input for the sequence data, node info and lineage
information.
